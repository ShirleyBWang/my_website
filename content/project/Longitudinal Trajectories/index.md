How do clinical behaviors and symptoms change over time, and how can we model these patterns? In collaboration with [Dianne Neumark-Sztainer](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/dianne-neumark-sztainer) and [Ann Haynos](https://www.med.umn.edu/bio/psychiatry/ann-haynos), my work in this area has examined longitudinal trajectories of eating disorder symptoms and body dissatisfaction using data from [Project EAT](http://www.sphresearch.umn.edu/epi/project-eat/) across 15 years from adolescence to adulthood.
