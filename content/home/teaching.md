### **Applied Machine Learning in R** 
**Pittsburgh Summer Methodology Series | July 19 - July 23, 2021**

This summer, [Jeffrey Girard](https://jmgirard.com/) and I will teach an online workshop to provide a hands-on introduction to machine learning methods for social and behavioral scientists. Opportunities for methodological consulting will also be provided. For more information and to register, please visit the Pitt Summer Methods [website](https://www.pittmethods.com/applied-ml).

### **Introduction to R**
**Massachusetts General Hospital | Spring 2021**

I have previously taught workshops providing an introduction to R for researchers with prior data analysis experience in other statistical software programs (e.g., SPSS), but no prior experience in R. All materials, including slides and R code, are available on my [github](https://github.com/ShirleyBWang/R_workshop_mgh).

### **PSY 1900: Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences**
**Harvard University | Fall 2019**

I have previously served as a teaching fellow for PSY 1900 with [Patrick Mair](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/patrick-mair). I taught two lab sections per week and covered the following topics in R: descriptive statistics, data visualization, correlation, regression, ANOVA, and effect sizes.
