Chiara is a Junior at Harvard College concentrating in Psychology with a secondary in English. Her primary research interests involve emotion processing, specifically how facial expression of emotions are processed by different cultures. Most recently however, she is interested in the emotional maturity, how this can be measured and what role it plays in eating disorders, anxiety, and non-suicidal self-harm. After her undergraduate career, she plans to apply to graduate school and pursue her interests in research.
