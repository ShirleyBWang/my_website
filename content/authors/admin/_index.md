**NOTE: I am no longer regularly updating this website (as of February 2024). For updated information, please visit my [lab website](https://ccslab.yale.edu/).**

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.yale.edu/) at Yale University (starting July 2024). My research integrates methods from across the clinical & computational sciences to advance the understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicide, nonsuicidal self-injury, and eating disorders. A central focus of this work includes formalizing theories of psychopathology as mathematical models, and modeling the real-time dynamics of symptoms (and their contexts) as they unfold in peopleâ€™s daily lives. 

My research has been published in over 50 scientific papers and book chapters, and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and several private foundations. This work has also been recognized by several awards, and I was recently listed as one of [Forbes' 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/profile/shirley-wang/?list=30under30-healthcare/&sh=7e7f3b965c85) in Healthcare.

I received my B.A. from The College of New Jersey (2017), my Ph.D. from Harvard University (2024), and am currently completing my predoctoral internship at Massachusetts General Hospital with the [Center for Precision Psychiatry](https://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/research/precision-psychiatry/about) and the [Center for Digital Mental Health](https://centerfordigitalmentalhealth.org/). 

I value diversity, inclusion, and belonging, and am committed to promoting these values in research, academia, clinical practice, and beyond. I believe that increasing representation of people from marginalized and historically disadvantaged backgrounds is critical for conducting ethical, comprehensive, and innovative clinical science research.
