I am a PhD candidate in clinical psychology with a secondary in computational science and engineering at Harvard University. I work with [Matt Nock](https://nocklab.fas.harvard.edu/people/matthew-k-nock-phd) and have been funded by the NIMH F31/NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. My research examines why people engage in behaviors that are harmful to themselves, including eating disorder behaviors, nonsuicidal self-injury, and suicide. I use a wide range of methods to study these problems, including laboratory-based behavioral experiments, real-time monitoring, and large-scale longitudinal studies. I am particularly interested in using mathematical and computational modeling to formalize theories in psychopathology.

I value diversity, inclusion, and belonging, and am committed to promoting these values in research, academia, clinical practice, and beyond. I believe that increasing representation of people from marginalized and historically disadvantaged backgrounds is critical for conducting ethical, comprehensive, and innovative clinical science research.

Starting Fall 2024, I am thrilled to be joining the [Psychology Department](https://psychology.yale.edu/) at Yale University as an Assistant Professor. My lab will integrate methods from across the clinical & computational sciences to advance the understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicide, nonsuicidal self-injury, and eating disorders.
